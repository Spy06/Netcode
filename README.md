A simple code, teaching you how to connect 2 different project using Dgram UDP Socket

UDP, is a protocol that allows user to send packets fast. Fast, i mean, the data can be duplicated, or dropped
And this is where the reliability system comes in, it will detect the lost packets, catch them so we can resend it again

NOTE: THERE ARE MAYBE SOME BUGS
