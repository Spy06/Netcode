(LEARNING ONLY)
A simple code, teaching you how to connect a server with more than 1 client using Dgram UDP Socket

UDP, is a protocol that allows user to send packets fast. Fast, i mean, the data can be duplicated, or dropped
And this is where the reliability system comes in, it will detect the lost packets, catch them so we can resend it again
Dont forget to set the Run In Background to true (Project Settings > Player)

NOTE: CURRENTLY IM LEARNING HOW TO DO THIS, SO THERE ARE PROBABLY SO MANY BUGS
NOTE AGAIN: YES, THERE ARE SO MANY BUGS lol
